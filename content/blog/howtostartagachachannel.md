ok! so, you want to start a gacha channel? here are some quick tips:

* figure out your vein of content! are you into FNAF? harry potter? attack on titan? or, are you stand-alone, making completely original content with only your ocs?
* make some characters in that are in that fandom, or your own personal ocs! preferably both if you make fan content.
* have a set theme: do you make meme videos? mini-movies? music videos? or do you want to make trends?
* if you want to go rouge and do none of this, thats also perfecly fine!

thanks for looking at this list, please know that all of this is my personal opinion, do not be mean to me please!
