**hi! in this second post abt making gacha channels, i am gonna talk abt how to make the videos! now, this is coming from _MY_ experience, so it will be a different from your experence.**

* prepare for the screenshots! unless you have _a lot_ of storage, know that you _will_ be deleting the screenshots after the video is made.


* you _will_ have to make things like a profile pic, headrer, and watermark! these are all things tha make you noticable, and noticeable is **_pretty_** inportent when making videos!


* have a app, or site, to make the videos on! i use capcut, but i may switch soon, as it is getting banned on the US.


**thats al the advice i have for you today, i hope that any aspiring gachatubers reading find this helpfull!**


**_update_** 

_capcut is not getting banned, but i am switching to kinemaster._
